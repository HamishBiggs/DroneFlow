# DroneFlow
Repository of publicly available code from the Drone Flow project.

Primarily Matlab code for various tasks within the Drone Flow project (for example extracting cross sections from moving boat ADCP gaugings).

Some other useful files are also included such as: "Biggs 2022 - Camera FOV and flight parameter calculator.xlsx" for calculating camera field of view and UAV flight parameters; and also code for image acquisition from a stereoscopic cameras comprising 2x BlackFly BFS-U3-51S5C-C Global Shutter Cameras.

Some of the code used in the Drone Flow project that was provided by collaborators could not be included in this repository.

Warning: It is expected that users of this repository will be proficient programmers who are able to check the accuracy of the code for their required applications and adapt it as needed. There is no guarantee of the accuracy of the code, and there are likely to be bugs present (particularly when it is used outside of the operational conditions and input data for which it was written by the author). The code is 'Scientific Programming' and likely does not follow any well established programming conventions (appologies in advance). However, variables and function names are descriptive, which should help you follow the code, and it is also generally well commented. Good luck! ;)

Hopefully some of the code will prove useful, or at least speed up parallel development projects. Some of the code can be provided as compiled versions if needed for use with the Matlab Runtime Libraries (upon reasonable request).

If code is useful and is used for scientific purposes, then please cite: "Biggs, H.J. (2022). Drone Flow User Guide. NIWA, Christchurch, New Zealand."
This user guide provides information on the functions released in this toolbox in the appendices. The user guide is available here: #######

To do:
Add link to the 'Drone Flow User Guide' where it is hosted on Research Gate once it is released.
